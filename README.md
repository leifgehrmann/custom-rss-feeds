# Custom RSS Feeds

Many websites don't have a nice RSS feed. This repostory is a collection of scripts that generates RSS feeds for random stuff online. Updates daily.

| Website | RSS Feed |
|---------|----------|
| [Expo Changelog](https://expo.dev/changelog) | [expo-changelog.xml](https://expo-rss.leifgehrmann.com/expo-changelog.xml) |

## Development

This project requires Node.js be installed.

```shell
npm ci
node feeds/expo-changelog.js > expo-changelog.xml
```
